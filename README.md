#### BLiMMP: Bacterially-linked Mercury Methylation and Production

***Also known as the Bendota project***

This project aims to investigate the link between overall microbial community production and metabolism and mercury methylation through the use of in situ incubations and metatranscriptomic studies. In particular, we are interested in how sulfate reduction influences MeHg production. Our study site is Lake Mendota, in Madison, WI.

Working hypothesis: MeHg formation occurs independent of sulfate reduction in the water column of Lake Mendota.

*Three objectives to evaluate that hypothesis*

1. Determine if water column MeHg production is a substantial/relevant/ important source of MeHg.

2. Experimentally test the role of sulfate-reducers on MeHg formation in the water column.

3. Investigate possible mechanisms underlying influence of sulfate-reducers on MeHg formation.


**Structure of project folder**

- analyses: Exploratory analysis files for many aspects of the project. Apologize for messy code and incomplete aspects.
- code: All the code that was involved in the project. This includes cleaning files that took the raw data and cleaned it up. 
- dataFinal: Final data that we worked with for the paper. Most of the visualization and statistical analysis scripts included in the repo should work with data in this folder (there might be a few exceptions). 
- metadata: Includes the raw and processed metadata files.
- protocols: Molecular extraction methods and sulfide analysis.
